# CryptoNotifier
Script for sending a notification about price of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

To run a code, it is necessary to write down keywords btc and eth in terminal in order to receive a price update.
Ex (in console): python3 project.py btc eth --> to receive updates for both cryptocurrencies (the order of the keywords does not matter).
